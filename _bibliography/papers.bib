However, no inorganic superionic conductors reported thus far satisfy these criteria. Nitrides exhibit intrinsically superior stability against reduction but are often readily oxidized at voltages as low as 0.6 V. In this article, we investigated all nitride-based compounds to search for materials with improved oxidative stabilities over 2.0 V while retaining their intrinsic stability against Li metal. We found two compounds, LiPN2 and Li2CN2, with high oxidative stability > 2.0 V and low vacancy migration energies. Using fine-tuned CHGNet machine-learning interatomic potential, we found that upon introducing aliovalent dopants to introduce vacancies in Li2CN2, the dopant and vacancy strongly anchor with each other to result in trapped vacancies, which lowers ionic conductivity. In contrast, vacancies and dopants have minimal interactions in LiPN2, resulting in a high ionic conductivity. These two compounds were synthesized, but their ionic conductivities were not successfully measured because of the challenges in densification. With improved processing conditions, these compounds may serve as anode-side separators in dual-separator-type all-solid-state batteries or anode buffer layer materials interfaced with lithium metal.}},

At the centre of this promising technology lie inorganic lithium superionic conductors, which facilitate rapid ion transport comparable to that in their liquid counterparts. Despite their promise, the limited availability of materials that both achieve superionic conductivity and fulfil all practical requirements necessitates the discovery of novel conductors. This Review comprehensively explores the diverse structural and chemical factors that improve ionic conductivity and the atomistic mechanism by which each factor affects it. We emphasize the importance of a dual approach: using structural factors to enable high-conducting prototypes, and chemical factors to further optimize the ionic conductivity. From these insights, we distil over 40 years of conductor development history to the key concepts that paved the way for today’s leading superionic conductors. In detailing the trajectory of ionic conduction advancements, this Review not only charts the progress in the field but also proposes a strategic approach for researchers to efficiently innovate with the ultimate goal of realizing the promise of all-solid-state batteries. Inorganic lithium superionic conductors are central to the development of solid-state batteries, but the availability of practical superionic conductors is still limited. This Review highlights structural and chemical strategies to enhance ionic conductivity and maps a strategic approach to discover, design and optimize fast lithium-ion conductors for safe and high-energy-density all-solid-state batteries.}},

However, it remains unclear whether the paddlewheel effect, defined as large-angle anion group rotations assisting Li hopping, indeed exists; furthermore, the physical mechanism by which the anion-group dynamics affect lithium-ion diffusion has not yet been established. In this work, we differentiate various types of rotational motions of anion groups and develop quaternion-based algorithms to detect, quantify, and relate them to lithium-ion motion in ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Our analysis demonstrates that, in fact, the paddlewheel effect, where an anion group makes a large angle rotation to assist a lithium-ion hop, does not exist and thus is not responsible for the fast lithium-ion diffusion in superionic conductors, as historically claimed. Instead, we find that materials with topologically isolated anion groups can enhance lithium-ion diffusivity via a more classic nondynamic soft-cradle mechanism, where the anion groups tilt to provide optimal coordination to a lithium ion throughout the hopping process to lower the migration barrier. This anion-group disorder is static in nature, rather than dynamic and can explain most of the experimental observations. Our work substantiates the nonexistence of the long-debated paddlewheel effect and clarifies any correlation that may exist between anion-group rotations and fast ionic diffusion in inorganic materials.}},

Antifluorite‐type Li6CoO4 has attracted attention as a potential cathode additive owing to its remarkably high theoretical lithium extraction capacity. However, the complex mechanism of lithium extraction as well as the oxygen loss from Li6CoO4 is not well understood. A generalizable computational thermodynamics and experimental framework is presented to understand the lithium‐extraction pathway of Li6CoO4. It is found that one lithium per formula unit can be topotactically extracted from Li6CoO4, followed by an irreversible and nontopotactic phase transformation to Li2CoO3 or LiCoO2 depending on the temperature. The results show that peroxide species may form to charge‐compensate for Li extraction which is undesirable as this can lead to gas release during battery operation. It is suggested that charging Li6CoO4 at an elevated temperature that the electrolyte can withstand, redirects the reaction pathway and prevents the formation of intermediate peroxide species making it an effective and stable sacrificial cathode additive. Next‐generationsilicon anodes suffer from severe initial capacity loss. Antifluorite‐type Li6CoO4 can serve as an attractive sacrificial cathode additive by compensating for the irreversible capacity loss.

Although classical force fields often fail to describe the coupling between electronic states and ionic rearrangements, the more accurate ab initio molecular dynamics suffers from computational complexity that prevents long-time and large-scale simulations, which are essential to study technologically relevant phenomena. Here we present the Crystal Hamiltonian Graph Neural Network (CHGNet), a graph neural network-based machine-learning interatomic potential (MLIP) that models the universal potential energy surface. CHGNet is pretrained on the energies, forces, stresses and magnetic moments from the Materials Project Trajectory Dataset, which consists of over 10 years of density functional theory calculations of more than 1.5 million inorganic structures. The explicit inclusion of magnetic moments enables CHGNet to learn and accurately represent the orbital occupancy of electrons, enhancing its capability to describe both atomic and electronic degrees of freedom. We demonstrate several applications of CHGNet in solid-state materials, including charge-informed molecular dynamics in LixMnO2, the finite temperature phase diagram for LixFePO4 and Li diffusion in garnet conductors. We highlight the significance of charge information for capturing appropriate chemistry and provide insights into ionic systems with additional electronic degrees of freedom that cannot be observed by previous MLIPs. An outstanding challenge in materials science is doing large-scale simulations with complex electron interactions.

This framework presents reaction energy as a rarely used handle for polymorph selection, which influences the role of surface energy in promoting the nucleation of metastable phases. Through in situ characterization and density functional theory calculations on two distinct synthesis pathways targeting LiTiOPO4, we demonstrate how precursor selection and its effect on reaction energy can effectively be used to control which polymorph is obtained from solid-state synthesis.

The metastability of these phases at ambient temperature motivates a study to quantify their thermodynamic accessibility. Through calculating the electronic, configurational, and vibrational sources of free energy from first principles, a phase diagram of the crystalline Li2S–P2S5 space is constructed. New ground-state orderings are proposed for α-Li3PS4, HT-Li7PS6, LT-Li7PS6, and Li7P3S11. Well-established phase stability trends from experiments are recovered, such as polymorphic phase transitions in Li7PS6 and Li3PS4, and the instability of Li7P3S11 at high temperature. At ambient temperature, it is predicted that all superionic conductors in this space are indeed metastable but thermodynamically accessible. Vibrational and configurational sources of entropy are shown to be essential toward describing the stability of superionic conductors. New details of the Li sublattices are revealed and are found to be crucial toward accurately predicting configurational entropy.

Through a combination of electrochemical measurements, synchrotron micro‐X‐ray absorption and diffraction analyses, and density functional theory calculations, reveal for the first time that along with the standard Li+ transport during charge/discharge, indium in the Li‐In anode also participates in the redox reactions. The in‐situ generated In3+ preferentially occupies the vacant Li sites in the trigonal LYC lattice, leading to the formation, growth, and eventual stabilization of an anode‐electrolyte interphase (AEI) layer consisting of an In‐doped Li3‐xInxYCl6 (x = ≈0.2) phase.

Interestingly, the K ions are well separated from the Na-rich phases in the discharged state, and they form an intermediate phase in which K and Na ions are mixed at the top of charge. We discovered that such residual K ions prevent the collapse of the layered structure in the high-voltage regime, thereby improving the cycling stability in a Na-battery system.}},

abstract = {{Uranium hydride is a promising material for stationary hydrogen storage in fusion reactors. In this work, various material properties of uranium hydride in both ferromagnetic (FM) and paramagnetic (PM) states are calculated to determine the optimal first-principles calculation method. For the treatment of strongly correlated f-electrons, the PBE functional with a Hubbard U parameter of 0.6 eV is selected as the optimal method and provides accurate formation energies and reasonable structural properties of the FM state. Using this method, we test four model spin configurations to approximately simulate the PM state: FM, antiferromagnetic (AFM), special quasi-random structure (SQS) and nonmagnetic (NM) configurations. The FM and AFM configurations provide formation energy and lattice constants comparable to those of the SQS configuration, which is used as the reference PM state. In addition, the experimental results on thermal expansion and the bulk modulus in the PM states are well reproduced with the FM, AFM and SQS configurations. These results demonstrate that PBE+U with FM, AFM and SQS configurations can approximately simulate the PM states, although there are some properties that can only be qualitatively reproduced by DFT calculations, such as the magnetic transition. This study enables the design of multiscale modeling for uranium hydride while maintaining simultaneous efficiency and accuracy.}},
