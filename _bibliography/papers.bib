abstract = {{It is desirable to develop solid electrolytes that have both excellent reductive stability against lithium metal and oxidative stability against high-voltage cathodes. However, no inorganic superionic conductors reported thus far satisfy these criteria. Nitrides exhibit intrinsically superior stability against reduction but are often readily oxidized at voltages as low as 0.6 V. In this article, we investigated all nitride-based compounds to search for materials with improved oxidative stabilities over 2.0 V while retaining their intrinsic stability against Li metal. We found two compounds, LiPN2 and Li2CN2, with high oxidative stability > 2.0 V and low vacancy migration energies. Using fine-tuned CHGNet machine-learning interatomic potential, we found that upon introducing aliovalent dopants to introduce vacancies in Li2CN2, the dopant and vacancy strongly anchor with each other to result in trapped vacancies, which lowers ionic conductivity. In contrast, vacancies and dopants have minimal interactions in LiPN2, resulting in a high ionic conductivity. These two compounds were synthesized, but their ionic conductivities were not successfully measured because of the challenges in densification. With improved processing conditions, these compounds may serve as anode-side separators in dual-separator-type all-solid-state batteries or anode buffer layer materials interfaced with lithium metal.}},

abstract = {{The quest for next-generation energy-storage technologies has pivoted towards all-solid-state batteries, primarily owing to their potential for enhanced safety and energy density. At the centre of this promising technology lie inorganic lithium superionic conductors, which facilitate rapid ion transport comparable to that in their liquid counterparts. Despite their promise, the limited availability of materials that both achieve superionic conductivity and fulfil all practical requirements necessitates the discovery of novel conductors. This Review comprehensively explores the diverse structural and chemical factors that improve ionic conductivity and the atomistic mechanism by which each factor affects it. We emphasize the importance of a dual approach: using structural factors to enable high-conducting prototypes, and chemical factors to further optimize the ionic conductivity. From these insights, we distil over 40 years of conductor development history to the key concepts that paved the way for today’s leading superionic conductors. In detailing the trajectory of ionic conduction advancements, this Review not only charts the progress in the field but also proposes a strategic approach for researchers to efficiently innovate with the ultimate goal of realizing the promise of all-solid-state batteries. Inorganic lithium superionic conductors are central to the development of solid-state batteries, but the availability of practical superionic conductors is still limited. This Review highlights structural and chemical strategies to enhance ionic conductivity and maps a strategic approach to discover, design and optimize fast lithium-ion conductors for safe and high-energy-density all-solid-state batteries.}},

Herein, we reveal that corner-sharing connectivity of the oxide crystal structure framework promotes superionic conductivity, which we rationalize from the distorted lithium environment and reduced interaction between lithium and non-lithium cations. By performing a high-throughput search for materials with this feature, we discover ten new oxide frameworks predicted to exhibit superionic conductivity—from which we experimentally demonstrate LiGa(SeO3)2 with a bulk ionic conductivity of 0.11 mS cm−1 and an activation energy of 0.17 eV. Our findings provide insight into the factors that govern fast lithium mobility in oxide materials and will accelerate the development of new oxide electrolytes for all-solid-state batteries. Superionic lithium conductivity has only been observed in a few classes of materials, mostly in thiophosphates but rarely in oxides. Corner-sharing connectivity in an oxide crystal structure framework is now shown to promote superionic conductivity.}},
