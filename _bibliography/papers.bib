abstract = {{Ion-exchange reactions are commonly used to develop novel metastable electrode materials for alkali-ion batteries that cannot be synthesized using direct chemical reactions. In this study, the electrochemical K to Na ion-exchange reaction mechanisms in a layered K x CoO2 cathode as a model system were investigated using operando and ex situ structure characterization techniques. Some level of K ions was observed to remain in the layered structure during the electrochemical ion-exchange reactions. Interestingly, the K ions are well separated from the Na-rich phases in the discharged state, and they form an intermediate phase in which K and Na ions are mixed at the top of charge. We discovered that such residual K ions prevent the collapse of the layered structure in the high-voltage regime, thereby improving the cycling stability in a Na-battery system.}},

abstract = {{Superionic lithium conductivity has only been discovered in a few classes of materials, mostly found in thiophosphates and rarely in oxides. Herein, we reveal that corner-sharing connectivity of the oxide crystal structure framework promotes superionic conductivity, which we rationalize from the distorted lithium environment and reduced interaction between lithium and non-lithium cations. By performing a high-throughput search for materials with this feature, we discover ten new oxide frameworks predicted to exhibit superionic conductivity—from which we experimentally demonstrate LiGa(SeO3)2 with a bulk ionic conductivity of 0.11 mS cm−1 and an activation energy of 0.17 eV. Our findings provide insight into the factors that govern fast lithium mobility in oxide materials and will accelerate the development of new oxide electrolytes for all-solid-state batteries. Superionic lithium conductivity has only been observed in a few classes of materials, mostly in thiophosphates but rarely in oxides. Corner-sharing connectivity in an oxide crystal structure framework is now shown to promote superionic conductivity.}},

abstract = {{The key component in lithium solid‐state batteries (SSBs) is the solid electrolyte composed of lithium superionic conductors (SICs). Lithium oxide SICs offer improved electrochemical and chemical stability compared with sulfides, and their recent advancements have largely been achieved using materials in the garnet‐ and NASICON (sodium superionic conductor)‐ structured families. In this work, using the ion‐conduction mechanisms in garnet and NASICON as inspiration, a common pattern of an “activated diffusion network” and three structural features that are beneficial for superionic conduction: a 3D percolation Li diffusion network, short distances between occupied Li sites, and the “homogeneity” of the transport path are identified. A high‐throughput computational screening is performed to search for new lithium oxide SICs that share these features. From this search, seven candidates are proposed exhibiting high room‐temperature ionic conductivity evaluated using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Their structural frameworks including spinel, oxy‐argyrodite, sodalite, and LiM(SeO3)2 present new opportunities for enriching the structural families of lithium oxide SICs. By representing the diffusion mechanism of garnet and NASICON structures in ion diffusion networks, a common pattern of “activated local environments” is identified. High‐throughput computational screening is performed to search for novel fast Li‐ion conductors that share this feature and seven candidates are proposed that exhibit high room‐temperature ionic conductivity, enriching the currently limited structural families of oxide superionic conductors.}},

abstract = {{Uranium hydride is a promising material for stationary hydrogen storage in fusion reactors. In this work, various material properties of uranium hydride in both ferromagnetic (FM) and paramagnetic (PM) states are calculated to determine the optimal first-principles calculation method. For the treatment of strongly correlated f-electrons, the PBE functional with a Hubbard U parameter of 0.6 eV is selected as the optimal method and provides accurate formation energies and reasonable structural properties of the FM state. Using this method, we test four model spin configurations to approximately simulate the PM state: FM, antiferromagnetic (AFM), special quasi-random structure (SQS) and nonmagnetic (NM) configurations. The FM and AFM configurations provide formation energy and lattice constants comparable to those of the SQS configuration, which is used as the reference PM state. In addition, the experimental results on thermal expansion and the bulk modulus in the PM states are well reproduced with the FM, AFM and SQS configurations. These results demonstrate that PBE+U with FM, AFM and SQS configurations can approximately simulate the PM states, although there are some properties that can only be qualitatively reproduced by DFT calculations, such as the magnetic transition. This study enables the design of multiscale modeling for uranium hydride while maintaining simultaneous efficiency and accuracy.}},
