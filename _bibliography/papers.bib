Initial attempts to synthesize this compound result in low purity (≤40\% by weight) owing to close thermodynamic competition with Li2O and MnO at low temperature. However, it is shown that a much higher purity of 85\% by weight can be achieved by combining Li excess with rapid cooling from high temperature, which effectively stabilizes the Li6MnO4 phase. The synthesized product delivers a high irreversible Li release capacity that exceeds 700 mAh g−1 by utilizing combined Mn oxidation (Mn2+/3+ and Mn3+/4+) and O oxidation. These results demonstrate that Li6MnO4 may therefore be useful as a potential sacrificial cathode additive in Li‐ion batteries and motivate further investigation of other structurally‐related compounds. While attempts were made to synthesize two additional compounds among computationally screened candidates, it was not successful to experimentally realize the two candidates. The difficulty of experimental realization of the newly predicted materials remains a challenge and it is suggested that more efforts need to be devoted to developing computational techniques to precisely predict synthesizability and propose potential synthetic routes of the predicted materials.

However, no inorganic superionic conductors reported thus far satisfy these criteria. Nitrides exhibit intrinsically superior stability against reduction but are often readily oxidized at voltages as low as 0.6 V. In this article, we investigated all nitride-based compounds to search for materials with improved oxidative stabilities over 2.0 V while retaining their intrinsic stability against Li metal. We found two compounds, LiPN2 and Li2CN2, with high oxidative stability > 2.0 V and low vacancy migration energies. Using fine-tuned CHGNet machine-learning interatomic potential, we found that upon introducing aliovalent dopants to introduce vacancies in Li2CN2, the dopant and vacancy strongly anchor with each other to result in trapped vacancies, which lowers ionic conductivity. In contrast, vacancies and dopants have minimal interactions in LiPN2, resulting in a high ionic conductivity. These two compounds were synthesized, but their ionic conductivities were not successfully measured because of the challenges in densification. With improved processing conditions, these compounds may serve as anode-side separators in dual-separator-type all-solid-state batteries or anode buffer layer materials interfaced with lithium metal.}},

At the centre of this promising technology lie inorganic lithium superionic conductors, which facilitate rapid ion transport comparable to that in their liquid counterparts. Despite their promise, the limited availability of materials that both achieve superionic conductivity and fulfil all practical requirements necessitates the discovery of novel conductors. This Review comprehensively explores the diverse structural and chemical factors that improve ionic conductivity and the atomistic mechanism by which each factor affects it. We emphasize the importance of a dual approach: using structural factors to enable high-conducting prototypes, and chemical factors to further optimize the ionic conductivity. From these insights, we distil over 40 years of conductor development history to the key concepts that paved the way for today’s leading superionic conductors. In detailing the trajectory of ionic conduction advancements, this Review not only charts the progress in the field but also proposes a strategic approach for researchers to efficiently innovate with the ultimate goal of realizing the promise of all-solid-state batteries. Inorganic lithium superionic conductors are central to the development of solid-state batteries, but the availability of practical superionic conductors is still limited.

However, it remains unclear whether the paddlewheel effect, defined as large-angle anion group rotations assisting Li hopping, indeed exists; furthermore, the physical mechanism by which the anion-group dynamics affect lithium-ion diffusion has not yet been established. In this work, we differentiate various types of rotational motions of anion groups and develop quaternion-based algorithms to detect, quantify, and relate them to lithium-ion motion in ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Our analysis demonstrates that, in fact, the paddlewheel effect, where an anion group makes a large angle rotation to assist a lithium-ion hop, does not exist and thus is not responsible for the fast lithium-ion diffusion in superionic conductors, as historically claimed. Instead, we find that materials with topologically isolated anion groups can enhance lithium-ion diffusivity via a more classic nondynamic soft-cradle mechanism, where the anion groups tilt to provide optimal coordination to a lithium ion throughout the hopping process to lower the migration barrier. This anion-group disorder is static in nature, rather than dynamic and can explain most of the experimental observations. Our work substantiates the nonexistence of the long-debated paddlewheel effect and clarifies any correlation that may exist between anion-group rotations and fast ionic diffusion in inorganic materials.}},

Antifluorite‐type Li6CoO4 has attracted attention as a potential cathode additive owing to its remarkably high theoretical lithium extraction capacity. However, the complex mechanism of lithium extraction as well as the oxygen loss from Li6CoO4 is not well understood. A generalizable computational thermodynamics and experimental framework is presented to understand the lithium‐extraction pathway of Li6CoO4. It is found that one lithium per formula unit can be topotactically extracted from Li6CoO4, followed by an irreversible and nontopotactic phase transformation to Li2CoO3 or LiCoO2 depending on the temperature. The results show that peroxide species may form to charge‐compensate for Li extraction which is undesirable as this can lead to gas release during battery operation. It is suggested that charging Li6CoO4 at an elevated temperature that the electrolyte can withstand, redirects the reaction pathway and prevents the formation of intermediate peroxide species making it an effective and stable sacrificial cathode additive. Next‐generationsilicon anodes suffer from severe initial capacity loss. Antifluorite‐type Li6CoO4 can serve as an attractive sacrificial cathode additive by compensating for the irreversible capacity loss.

The high temperature required to form equilibrium Zr disorder precludes any equilibrium synthesis processes for achieving fast Li-ion conductivity, rationalizing why only nonequilibrium synthesis methods, such as ball-milling, lead to good conductivity.

Although classical force fields often fail to describe the coupling between electronic states and ionic rearrangements, the more accurate ab initio molecular dynamics suffers from computational complexity that prevents long-time and large-scale simulations, which are essential to study technologically relevant phenomena. Here we present the Crystal Hamiltonian Graph Neural Network (CHGNet), a graph neural network-based machine-learning interatomic potential (MLIP) that models the universal potential energy surface. CHGNet is pretrained on the energies, forces, stresses and magnetic moments from the Materials Project Trajectory Dataset, which consists of over 10 years of density functional theory calculations of more than 1.5 million inorganic structures. The explicit inclusion of magnetic moments enables CHGNet to learn and accurately represent the orbital occupancy of electrons, enhancing its capability to describe both atomic and electronic degrees of freedom. We demonstrate several applications of CHGNet in solid-state materials, including charge-informed molecular dynamics in LixMnO2, the finite temperature phase diagram for LixFePO4 and Li diffusion in garnet conductors. We highlight the significance of charge information for capturing appropriate chemistry and provide insights into ionic systems with additional electronic degrees of freedom that cannot be observed by previous MLIPs. An outstanding challenge in materials science is doing large-scale simulations with complex electron interactions.

The metastability of these phases at ambient temperature motivates a study to quantify their thermodynamic accessibility. Through calculating the electronic, configurational, and vibrational sources of free energy from first principles, a phase diagram of the crystalline Li2S–P2S5 space is constructed. New ground-state orderings are proposed for α-Li3PS4, HT-Li7PS6, LT-Li7PS6, and Li7P3S11. Well-established phase stability trends from experiments are recovered, such as polymorphic phase transitions in Li7PS6 and Li3PS4, and the instability of Li7P3S11 at high temperature. At ambient temperature, it is predicted that all superionic conductors in this space are indeed metastable but thermodynamically accessible. Vibrational and configurational sources of entropy are shown to be essential toward describing the stability of superionic conductors.

In this study, we highlight a consistent potential energy surface (PES) softening effect in three uMLIPs: M3GNet, CHGNet, and MACE-MP-0, which is characterized by energy and force underprediction in atomic-modeling benchmarks including surfaces, defects, solid-solution energetics, ion migration barriers, phonon vibration modes, and general high-energy states. The PES softening behavior originates primarily from the systematically underpredicted PES curvature, which derives from the biased sampling of near-equilibrium atomic arrangements in uMLIP pre-training datasets.

abstract = {{All‐solid‐state‐batteries (ASSBs) based on a halide solid electrolyte (SE) and a lithium‐metal based anode typically have poor cyclability without a buffer layer (such as Li3PS4 or Li6PS5Cl) to prevent the degradation reactions. Here excellent cycling stability of ASSB consisting of an uncoated single‐crystal LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathode and a Li3YCl6 (LYC) SE separator in direct contact with a Li‐In anode are demonstrated. Through a combination of electrochemical measurements, synchrotron micro‐X‐ray absorption and diffraction analyses, and density functional theory calculations, reveal for the first time that along with the standard Li+ transport during charge/discharge, indium in the Li‐In anode also participates in the redox reactions. The in‐situ generated In3+ preferentially occupies the vacant Li sites in the trigonal LYC lattice, leading to the formation, growth, and eventual stabilization of an anode‐electrolyte interphase (AEI) layer consisting of an In‐doped Li3‐xInxYCl6 (x = ≈0.2) phase. It is discussed how the presence of such an AEI layer prevents LYC decomposition and suppresses dendrite formation and propagation, enabling stable cycling of ASSB with ≈90\% capacity retention over 1000 cycles. This work sheds light on the dynamic evolution of the halide SE and alloy anode interphase, and opens new avenues in the future design of long‐lasting high‐energy all‐solid‐state‐batteries. This study reveals In redox reactions at the interface between a halide solid‐electrolyte and a Li‐In alloy anode. The migration of the in situ generated In3+ leads to the formation, growth, and eventual stabilization of a Li3‐xInxYCl6 anode‐electrolyte interphase over cycling. Such dynamic evolution enables the excellent performance of high‐energy NMC811 all‐solid‐state‐battery cells, with ≈90\% capacity retention after 1000 cycles.}},

abstract = {{Phase diagrams offer substantial predictive power for materials synthesis by identifying the stability regions of target phases. However, thermodynamic phase diagrams do not offer explicit information regarding the kinetic competitiveness of undesired by-product phases. Here we propose a quantitative and computable thermodynamic metric to identify synthesis conditions under which the propensity to form kinetically competing by-products is minimized. We hypothesize that thermodynamic competition is minimized when the difference in free energy between a target phase and the minimal energy of all other competing phases is maximized. We validate this hypothesis for aqueous materials synthesis through two empirical approaches: first, by analysing 331 aqueous synthesis recipes text-mined from the literature; and second, by systematic experimental synthesis of LiIn(IO3)4 and LiFePO4 across a wide range of aqueous electrochemical conditions. Our results show that even for synthesis conditions that are within the stability region of a thermodynamic Pourbaix diagram, phase-pure synthesis occurs only when thermodynamic competition with undesired phases is minimized.   Precipitation of target functional materials from water is sensitive to precursor selection and aqueous electrochemistry (pH and redox potential), where competition between thermodynamics and kinetics can yield undesired impurity phases. Now, a theoretical framework to identify optimal synthesis conditions of target materials is developed and validated against a literature dataset and direct experiments.}},

Herein, we reveal that corner-sharing connectivity of the oxide crystal structure framework promotes superionic conductivity, which we rationalize from the distorted lithium environment and reduced interaction between lithium and non-lithium cations. By performing a high-throughput search for materials with this feature, we discover ten new oxide frameworks predicted to exhibit superionic conductivity—from which we experimentally demonstrate LiGa(SeO3)2 with a bulk ionic conductivity of 0.11 mS cm−1 and an activation energy of 0.17 eV. Our findings provide insight into the factors that govern fast lithium mobility in oxide materials and will accelerate the development of new oxide electrolytes for all-solid-state batteries.

Corner-sharing connectivity in an oxide crystal structure framework is now shown to promote superionic conductivity.}},

Lithium oxide SICs offer improved electrochemical and chemical stability compared with sulfides, and their recent advancements have largely been achieved using materials in the garnet‐ and NASICON (sodium superionic conductor)‐ structured families. In this work, using the ion‐conduction mechanisms in garnet and NASICON as inspiration, a common pattern of an “activated diffusion network” and three structural features that are beneficial for superionic conduction: a 3D percolation Li diffusion network, short distances between occupied Li sites, and the “homogeneity” of the transport path are identified. A high‐throughput computational screening is performed to search for new lithium oxide SICs that share these features. From this search, seven candidates are proposed exhibiting high room‐temperature ionic conductivity evaluated using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Their structural frameworks including spinel, oxy‐argyrodite, sodalite, and LiM(SeO3)2 present new opportunities for enriching the structural families of lithium oxide SICs. By representing the diffusion mechanism of garnet and NASICON structures in ion diffusion networks, a common pattern of “activated local environments” is identified.

Some level of K ions was observed to remain in the layered structure during the electrochemical ion-exchange reactions. Interestingly, the K ions are well separated from the Na-rich phases in the discharged state, and they form an intermediate phase in which K and Na ions are mixed at the top of charge. We discovered that such residual K ions prevent the collapse of the layered structure in the high-voltage regime, thereby improving the cycling stability in a Na-battery system.}},

In this work, various material properties of uranium hydride in both ferromagnetic (FM) and paramagnetic (PM) states are calculated to determine the optimal first-principles calculation method. For the treatment of strongly correlated f-electrons, the PBE functional with a Hubbard U parameter of 0.6 eV is selected as the optimal method and provides accurate formation energies and reasonable structural properties of the FM state. Using this method, we test four model spin configurations to approximately simulate the PM state: FM, antiferromagnetic (AFM), special quasi-random structure (SQS) and nonmagnetic (NM) configurations. The FM and AFM configurations provide formation energy and lattice constants comparable to those of the SQS configuration, which is used as the reference PM state. In addition, the experimental results on thermal expansion and the bulk modulus in the PM states are well reproduced with the FM, AFM and SQS configurations. These results demonstrate that PBE+U with FM, AFM and SQS configurations can approximately simulate the PM states, although there are some properties that can only be qualitatively reproduced by DFT calculations, such as the magnetic transition. This study enables the design of multiscale modeling for uranium hydride while maintaining simultaneous efficiency and accuracy.}},
