Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

I am a postdoc at MIT, DMSE, working with [Prof. Rafael GÃ³mez-Bombarelli](https://gomezbombarelli.mit.edu/kyujung/). I received my Ph.D. from `Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of California, Berkeley`, advised by [Professor Gerbrand Ceder](https://ceder.berkeley.edu). I obtained my Bachelor's degree in 2018 from Seoul National University, S. Korea (Major: Nuclear engineering, Minor: Materials Science and Engineering).

My research focuses on the computational discovery and mechanistic understanding of fast Li-ion conductors across diverse chemical spaces, including inorganic crystals, polymers, and molecular systems, for electrochemical energy storage. I leverage quantum mechanical and classical models, machine learning-accelerated simulations, trajectory analysis algorithms, and thermodynamics to uncover design principles that enable safer and more efficient energy storage devices.

I am particularly excited about harnessing machine learning-driven simulations to extend the spatiotemporal reach of physical insights and uncover unprecedented physical phenomena that were previously unattainable with expensive quantum mechanical calculations or less-accurate classical models.
