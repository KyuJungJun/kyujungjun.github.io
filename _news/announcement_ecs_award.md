KyuJung receives ECS Battery Division Graduate Student Award at Gothenburg, Sweden! I was honored to give an award presentation to the battery community, talking about how we can utilize high-throughput computing to discover Li superionic conductors, as well as how computational models can shed light on the correlation between rotational motion of polyhedra and lithium-ion hops.
