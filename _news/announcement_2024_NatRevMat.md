Excited to share our <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41578-024-00715-9
">review article</a>, "Diffusion Mechanisms of Fast Lithium-Ion Conductors,” which is now published in Nature Reviews Materials!

What is it about these rare, specific crystal structures like argyrodites, NASICONs, or garnets that makes them fast Li-ion conductors? It’s a question I’ve been asking for the past years. Over the last decade, the solid electrolyte community has together gained a much deeper understanding of the factors that govern fast lithium-ion diffusion in inorganic crystal structures and has greatly expanded the chemical and structural diversity of lithium superionic conductors for use in all-solid-state batteries.

In this review, we explore the structural and chemical factors that drive fast lithium-ion diffusion, including perspectives from my own PhD research, to provide a comprehensive understanding of this evolving field. From these insights, we distill the development history of ionic conductors over the last several decades, laying out the key concepts that have paved the way for today’s state-of-the-art superionic conductors. The diversity of design principles for achieving superionic conduction suggests there is still huge potential for experimental and theoretical efforts to design new fast Li-ion conductors for all-solid-state batteries.

A big thank you to Professor Gerbrand Ceder for guiding this work, and to Yu Chen, Grace Wei, and Xiaochen Yang for working together on this paper. I hope our review paper will spark new ideas to improve superionic conductors for all-solid-state batteries!
