Excited to have led the computational search for sacrificial cathode additives to tackle the high irreversible capacity in the first cycle of Si-based anodes! This co-first-authored paper is published today at <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/aenm.202403946?campaign=wolearlyview">Advanced Energy Materials</a>. Among the candidates, we take a deeper dive into the antifluorite-structured Li6MnO4 among the candidates. Thank you to all the coauthors and especially Haegyeom Kim for leading this work.
